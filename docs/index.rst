Welcome to django-getpaid's documentation!
==========================================

**django-getpaid** is a carefully designed multi-broker payment processor for django applications. The main advantages of this django application are:
 * instead of only one payment broker, you can use **multiple payment brokers** in your application, what is wise considering ane single payment broker downtime,
 * payment brokers have a **flexible architecture** each one based on a django application structure (they can introduce own logic, views, urls, models),
 * support to **asynchronous** payment status change workflow (which is required by most brokers and is architecturally correct for production use),
 * support for payments in **multiple currencies** at the same time,
 * uses just a **minimal assumption** on your code, that you will have some kind of order model class.

The basic usage is to connect you order model class with `django-getpaid`. Because the `AbstractMixin` is used, Payment model class uses a real ``ForeignKey`` to your order class model, so it avoids messy django ``content_type`` relations.

This app was written because there still is not a single reliable or simple to use payment processor. There are many  payments related projects out there like `Satchmo <http://satchmoproject.sadba.org/docs/dev/>`_, `python-payflowpro <https://github.com/bkeating/python-payflowpro/>`_, `django-authorizenet <https://github.com/zen4ever/django-authorizenet>`_, `mamona <https://github.com/emesik/mamona>`_, `django-paypal <https://github.com/johnboxall/django-paypal>`_, `django-payme <https://github.com/bradleyayers/django-payme/>`_, but none of them are satisfying. `Mamona` project was the most interesting payment app out there (because of general conception), but still has got some serious architectural pitfalls. Therefore `django-getpaid` in the basic stage was aimed to be a next version of `mamona`. `django-getpaid` took many architectural decisions different than `mamona` and therefore has been started as a separate project, while still borrowing a lot of great ideas from `mamona`, like e.g. using `AbstractMixin`, dynamic model and urls loading, etc. Thanks `mamona`!



**Disclaimer:** this project has nothing in common with `getpaid <http://code.google.com/p/getpaid/>`_ plone project. It is mostly based on `mamona <https://github.com/emesik/mamona>`_ project.
